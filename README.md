# Cosine_Attack_Demonstration

Cosine Attack Demonstration on BMI Dataset

This project demonstrates a cosine attack using the BMI dataset. The attack shows how an unknown data point can be reconstructed by comparing its cosine similarities with a few buffer (known) data points.

Dataset :
We use the BMI Dataset , which contains:
  1) Gender: Male / Female
  2) Height: Height in cm
  3) Weight: Weight in kg
  4) Index: Health category (0 – Extremely Weak, …, 5 – Extreme Obesity)
